# 100 Days Of Code Diary / School of Code Bootcamp Diary
A diary documenting my 100 Days of Code learning Journey and my journey on the School of Code Bootcamp.

### **Day 0**

Prior to beginning my 100 Days of Code journey I had been an ESL teacher for 8 years. Last year I began to teach myself HTML and CSS whilst working full time. I used Codecademy as my main learning resource. 

In preperation for the School of Code Bootcamp I left my job and spent the 7 weeks beforehand trying to prepare myself as much as possible. I completed the JS Fundamental sections of Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript course on Udemy, as well as the Fundamentals section of his NodeJS course. I also had a brief introduction into using PostgresSQL. After that I managed to work my way through most of the Learn React for Free course on Scrimba and also had some time to refresh my Flexbox and Grid knowledge. I also reviewed my CSS and HTML knowledge as well as UI/UX design fundamentals. 

As part of the SOC pre-course task I was introduced to git and github. I also completed another course on Udacity where I learned the fundamentals of the command line and git.

### **Day 1**

My first day at School of Code. Lots of nervous excitment but met some wonderful people.

#### What we covered

- Introduction to computational thinking, and the importance of breaking problems down into smaller chunks. 
- Chris (our Teacher) talked about Imposter Syndrome; how we need to learn to just deal with it and how it will never really leave us.
- High level overview of agile vs waterfall development and also MVP's (Minimum Viable Products).
- Chris also talked about how the aim of the bootcamp was to mold us into a sort of MVP, so that employers could add to our training and we could develop ourselves further in areas we are interested in.
- Importance of using online resources to our advantage e.g. Google, Stack Overflow etc. 
- Introduction to pair progamming. We will do every activity/challenge in pairs. Taking turns to be the driver and navigator. Helping and learning from each other.
- CSS selectors game in pairs. My first experience with pair programming.

### **Day 2** 

- A deeper dive into computational thinking
- Lots of practice using git and github; using clone, add, commit, push , pull, status etc. 
- Chris talked to us about the usefulness of having a baby/child like mentality towards learning how to code: play with the tools, try to break things and then put them back together, see how it works.
- Some more practice with CSS. We made an koala bear cartoon image. 
- Refresher on semantic HTML.

### Day 3

-The first day of Javascript. Covered so much in one day! Feel glad I covered the basics of JS in my personal course prep, or it could have been very overwhelming. Today we covered:
- Data types and variables 
- If statements
- While loops
- Functions
- We then made a basic password checker algorithm with our pair programming partners.

### Day 4

In the morning we had a workshop about the importance of mindset and The Heroes Journey. We also discussed productive ways of giving and recieving feedback.
- Afterwords we immediately dove right back into JavaScript, covering;
- Objects
- Arrays 
- More practice with for and while loops. 

### Day 5 - Hackathon Friday

So every Friday is Hackathon friday, where we spend the day completing a project in our pairs. Its a great opportunity to practise and cement the concepts we learned during the week. We then give a 2 minute presentation of our project to other groups at the end of the day. 

Todays challenge was to make a rock scissor paper game. We managed to complete the challenge using functions, arrays, if statements and while loops. The game generated a random move for the computer and also kept track of total games, wins, loses and draws. 

My coding partner and I were quite happy with the outcome of the task, given the limited time and knowledge we have. I'm looking forward to refactoring the code and adding DOM interactivity in my free time.

### Day 6 and 7 (Sunday and Bank Holiday Monday)

- Spent some time working through some classes on Scrimba's 'Learn JS for free' course. Reviewing, practising and cementing some concepts we learned during the week. 
- Introduction to Code Wars. Watched some videos about breaking code wars tasks down and completed a few challenges/ katas. Reached 7 Kyu level.

### Reflections after week 1 of the School of Code.

Things I've been reflecting on at the end of the week:

- Taking a few babysteps everyday will soon add up. Consistency is the key.
- Once I got used to pair-programming I can really see the benefits if it. We were catching each others errors as we went and often we solved problems by just talking it through with each other. 
- The importance of celebrating the little wins and learning from failures. It was especially nice to be be able to share the wins with my coding partner and also to support each other when failing. 
- 'Compare yourself to your past self and not to others'. This is also something our teachers have reitorated several times.
- But also, in relation to the previouse point, the reality that Imposter Syndrome is something that will come and go, and how it's basically something I will just have to learn to live with.
- The importance of taking breaks. Applying the mental approach I use in physical excercise such as, 'push forward' and 'dig deeper', seems to actually be a hindrance when trying to solve coding problems. I realised that taking a short break or coming back to the problem later can actually be far more effective.   


### Day 8 

Every week we are paired with a new partner, so we spend a little bit of time breaking the ice and getting to know each others working/communication styles before cracking on with the day. 

A very intense day, covered a LOT. Didn't have time to finish everything.
- Had a nice talk with some ex-bootcampers this morning. They weree sharing their experience, tips and advice with us. 
- Introduction to the DOM. 
- Practised selecting and manipulating elements.
- Lots of practice with event Listeners and Event Handlers. 

### Day 9 

- Before class I reviewed and finished the tasks from yesterday and now feel more confident with the material.
- Introduction to asynchronous functions, promises and Fetch requests.
- We used Fetch to retrieve data from a Kanye West quote api and then displayed the quotes on a webpage. We then created a button that stored the quotes into a list on the webpage and also excluded any repeated quotes from the list.

### Day 10

- More practice and workshops using Asynch functions and Fetch; making GET and POST requests.
- Weekly mindset talk , this time focusing on different personality types, the strengths and weaknesses of them.
- Spent some time refactoring my hackathon challenge from the previous week.

### Day 11 - Hackathon Friday

- We pair programmed a simple but effective dad joke site using async functions, fetch requests, and event handlers/listeners.
- We spent 30 minutes breaking the problem down and making a plan. We decided to make a high level overview plan which broke the problem up into multiple parts. Once we finished one part we would then zoom in on the next part and make a more detailed plan before completing it. We felt this way of planning/working was more fluid and veratile. It allowed us to respond to possible changes and also was more time effective. 
- We managed to reach our key goals before lunch and were able to focus on our strecth goals, which was to add CSS styling to the site.
- We then gave a two minute presentation of our project to some of our peers at the end of the day.
- I enjoyed using the tools we had learned in a more free-form environment. I.e. Make a plan and solve this problem. 
- When I have some freetime (hopefully over the weekend) I plan to refactor the code, add and input function that lets the user write and add their own joke to either list and clean up the CSS a little bit.


### Day 12 

Completed the SoC recap activites, which included;
- Manipulating arrays, searching filtering for specific info.
- Event handlers/listeners review.
- Using setInterval and clearInterval.
- DOM manipulation.
- Adding input vals to list.


### week 2 reflections

Things I've been reflecting on at the end of the week:

- This week felt like a real trial by fire, especially as we had lost a day of study to make up for due to the Bank Holiday.
- I'm getting used to being out of my comfort zone and somewhat comfortable with feeling confused a lot of the time. These moments of confusion are usually followed by brief, shining moments of clarity, before we move on to the next topic and more confusion begins to surround me. But hey, you can't enjoy the sunshine without experiencing the storms.
- Again with the cliches, but the old analogy of the boy falling of his horse, brushing himself off and climbing right back on came to my mind a lot this week. Every day my brain was like fried chicken by end of it, but I would decrompress, workout, relax then return to the materials before class in the mornings to find my understanding deepening and things becoming clearer. Thus, I am beginning to really trust in the learning process described by my teachers last week.
- I'm starting to see the benefits of the SoC slack channel. There is a really supportive and kind community there and I wish to get more involved in it.
- I'm also getting better at debugging. I've come to realise that the error log is often a source of helpful advice and not a cause for panic.


#### Notes on weekend  homework tasks 

Honestly this took longer than I expected. Once I completed the tasks I realized that I approached the tasks with the wrong mindset which hindered me greatly. I was just focused on trying to get them done as quickly as possible so that I could attend to some other commitments. I didn't break the problem down, didnt check the code properly as I was writing it and therefore made some silly errors that cost me a lot of time to find and correct. When I got stuck I used the wrong approach of just plowing forward instead of taking a step back and/or a short break, resulting in me just getting stuck further down the rabbit hole.

Thus, I realised that I needed to approach these problems the same way I would any other SoC challenge given during the weekdays: Break the problem down, make a plan and approach it methodically. Use the console.log and read error messages carefully. Make use of resources such as mdn, w3schools and stackoverflow when neccessary.

### Day 13

- We looked at the importance of UI/UX design. The difference between the two and the roles/importance of each.
- We then learned about Agile Development and the 12 principles of Agile software Development.
- Waterfall Development vs Agile Development. Advantages and disadvantages of each.
- Played the Can't Unsee game which was a good intro into the power of good design. 
- Some self reflection activities at the end of the day. 

### Day 14

- We took a deep dive into the 5 stages of Design Thinking:
    - Emphathise
    - Define
    - Ideate
    - Prototype
    - Test
- We discussed how this can often be an iterative process and we also practiced working through the stages in our own imaginary projects. 
- We also had time for a CSS workshop where we practised using CSS variables and we were able to implement a dark-mode feature on a simple website. 
- Solved a couple of Code Wars challenges in our pairs

### Day 15 

- Deeper dive into UI, and the elements and principles of design.
- Color theory and accessibility.
- We also looked at the LightHouse feature in Devtools.
- Introduction to wire-framing and practised making a mock-up wireframe using miro and figma.
- workshop on organising and maintaining CSS code. We also covered specificity.


reflections on the week

- began a more useful notetaking system after advice from a fellow bootcamper. Also discovered Trello
- can see the benefits of cognitive diversity after our design thinking activites. especially during the ideation phase - ie bouncing ideas off each other. 
- interesting doing wireframing on a compututer for the first time. 
- also intro was figma was useful. looked at tutorials after class and feel more confident with it.
