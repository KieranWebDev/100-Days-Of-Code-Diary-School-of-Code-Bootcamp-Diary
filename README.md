# 100-Days-Of-Code-Diary-School-of-Code-Bootcamp-Diary
A diary documenting my 100 Days of Code learning Journey and my journey on the School of Code Bootcamp

### Day 0

Prior to beginning my 100 Days of Code journey I had been an ESL teacher for 8 years. Last year I began to teach myself HTML and CSS whilst working full time. I used Codecademy as my main learning resource. 

In preperation for the School of Code Bootcamp I left my job and spent the 7 weeks beforehand trying to prepare myself as much as possible. I completed the JS Fundamental sections of Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript course, as well as the Fundamentals section of his NodeJS course. I also had a brief introduction into using PostgresSQL. After that I managed to work my way through most of the Learn React for Free course on Scrimba.com and also had some time to refresh my Flexbox and Grid knowledge. I also reviewed my CSS and HTML knowledge as well as UI/UX design fundamentals. 

As part of the SOC pre-course task I was introduced to git and github. I also completed another course on Udacity.com where I learned the fundamentals of the command line and git.

### Day 1

My first day at School of Code. Lots of nervouse excitment but met some wonderful people.

#### A brief map of the day

- Introduction to computational thinking, and the importanceof breaking problems down into smaller chunks. 
- Chris (our Teacher) talked about Imposter Syndrome; how we need to learn to just deal with it and how it will never really leave us.
- High level overview of agile vs waterfall development and also MVP's (Minimum Viable Products)
- Chris also talked about how the aim of the bootcamp was to mold us into a sort of MVP, so that employers could add to our training and we could develop ourselves further in areas we are interested in.
- Importance of using online resources to our advantage e.g. google, stack overflow etc. 
- Introduction to pair progamming. We will do every activity/challenge in pairs. Taking turns to be the driver and navigator. Helping and learning from each other.
