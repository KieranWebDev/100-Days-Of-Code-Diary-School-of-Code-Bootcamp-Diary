# 100 Days Of Code Diary / School of Code Bootcamp Diary
A diary documenting my 100 Days of Code learning Journey and my journey on the School of Code Bootcamp

### **Day 0**

Prior to beginning my 100 Days of Code journey I had been an ESL teacher for 8 years. Last year I began to teach myself HTML and CSS whilst working full time. I used Codecademy as my main learning resource. 

In preperation for the School of Code Bootcamp I left my job and spent the 7 weeks beforehand trying to prepare myself as much as possible. I completed the JS Fundamental sections of Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript course, as well as the Fundamentals section of his NodeJS course. I also had a brief introduction into using PostgresSQL. After that I managed to work my way through most of the Learn React for Free course on Scrimba.com and also had some time to refresh my Flexbox and Grid knowledge. I also reviewed my CSS and HTML knowledge as well as UI/UX design fundamentals. 

As part of the SOC pre-course task I was introduced to git and github. I also completed another course on Udacity.com where I learned the fundamentals of the command line and git.

### **Day 1**

My first day at School of Code. Lots of nervouse excitment but met some wonderful people.

#### A brief map of the day

- Introduction to computational thinking, and the importanceof breaking problems down into smaller chunks. 
- Chris (our Teacher) talked about Imposter Syndrome; how we need to learn to just deal with it and how it will never really leave us.
- High level overview of agile vs waterfall development and also MVP's (Minimum Viable Products)
- Chris also talked about how the aim of the bootcamp was to mold us into a sort of MVP, so that employers could add to our training and we could develop ourselves further in areas we are interested in.
- Importance of using online resources to our advantage e.g. google, stack overflow etc. 
- Introduction to pair progamming. We will do every activity/challenge in pairs. Taking turns to be the driver and navigator. Helping and learning from each other.
- CSS selectors game in pairs. My first experience with pair programming.

### **Day 2** 

#### A brief map of the day

- A deeper dive into computational thinking
- Lots of practice using git and github; using clone, add, commit, push , pull, status etc. 
- Chris talked to us about the usefullness of having a baby/child like mentality towards learning how to code. Play with the tools, try to break things and then put them back together, see how it works.
- Some more practice with CSS. We made an Koala cartoon image. 
- Refresher on semantic HTML.


### Day 3

-The first day of Javascript. Covered so much in one day! Feel glad I covered the basics of JS in my personal course prep, or it could have been very overwhelming. Today we covered:
- data types and variables 
- if statements
- While loops
- functions
- we then made a basic password checker alMade a basic password checker algorithm with our pair programming partners.

### Day 4

-in the morning we had a workshop about the importance of mindset and The Heroes Journey. We also discussed productive ways of giving and recieving feedback.
- after that we immediately dove right back into JavaScript, covering;
- Objects
- Arrays 
- More practice with for and while loops. 

### Day 5 - Hackathon Friday

So every Friday is Hackathon friday we spend the day completed a project in our pairs. Its a great opportunity to practise and cement the concepts we learned during the week. We then give a 2 minute presentation of our project to other groups at the end of the day. 

Todays challenge was to make a rock scissor paper game. We managed to complete the challenge using functions, arrays, if statements and while loops. The game generated a random move and also kept track of total games, wins, loses and draws. 

My coding partner and I were quite happy with the outcome of the task, given the limited time and knowledge we have. I'm looking forward to refactoring the code and adding DOM interactivity in my free time

### reflections on the first week of School of Code

- baby steps
- clelebrate the small wins
- learn from the failures 
- benefits and challenges of pair programming
- imposter syndrome. dont compare yourself to others
- importance of taking breaks - pushing through with a frazlled brain not the best option. 
- compare yourself to yourself yesterday. 


### Day 6 (Saturday)

- Spent some time working through some classes on Scrimba's 'Learn JS for free' course. Reviewing, practising and cementing some concepts we learned during the week. 

### Day 7 (Bank Holiday Monday)

-Introduction to Code Wars. Watched some videos about breaking code wars tasks down and completed a few challenges/ katas. Reached 7 Kyu level.

### Day 8 

Every week we are paired with a new partner, so we spend a little bit of time breaking the ice and getting to know each others working/communication styles before cracking on with the day. 

A very intense day, covered a LOT. Didn't have time to finish everything.
- had a nice talk with some ex-bootcampers this morning. They weree sharing their experience, tips and advice with us. 
- Introduction to the DOM 
- practised selecting anf manipulating elements
- lots of practice with event Listeners and Event Handlers. 
- 

### Day 9 

- Before class I reviewed and finished tasks from yesterday and feel more confident with the material.
- Introduction to asynchronous functions, promises and Fetch requests.
- we used Fetch to retrieve data from a kanye west quote api and then displayed the quotes on a webpage. We were then able to implement an event which added the quotes to a list on the browser. ---edit this. clunky 

### Day 10



### week 2 reflections

-trial by fire
used to being constantly confused. and brief moments of clarity. part of the process.
- pick yourself up, dust off and keep back on the horse. maybe compare to running fall. get back on the horse quickly or you will develop the fear. 
- getting used to being outside of comfot zone.
- first time applying some of the concepts I learned in a more free-form environment. I.e use all the tools we gave you to solve this problem , rather than use a loop for this problem, now use a if statement for this one etc. 
- felt like making great progress, things were clicking, competing tasks. but then two laters strugling with seemingly basic tasks on the homework.
- approached homework with wrong attitude. trying to rush through, making silly mistakes. not breaking problem down. 
- benefits of slack community - share the struggle
