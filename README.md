# 100 Days Of Code Diary / School of Code Bootcamp Diary
A diary documenting my 100 Days of Code learning Journey and my journey on the School of Code Bootcamp.

### **Day 0**

Prior to beginning my 100 Days of Code journey I had been an ESL teacher for 8 years. Last year I began to teach myself HTML and CSS whilst working full time. I used Codecademy as my main learning resource. 

In preparation for the School of Code Bootcamp I left my job and spent the 7 weeks beforehand trying to prepare myself as much as possible. I completed the JS Fundamental sections of Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript course on Udemy, as well as the Fundamentals section of his NodeJS course. I also had a brief introduction into using PostgresSQL. After that I managed to work my way through most of the Learn React for Free course on Scrimba and also had some time to refresh my Flexbox and Grid knowledge. I also reviewed my CSS and HTML knowledge as well as UI/UX design fundamentals. 

As part of the SOC pre-course task I was introduced to git and github. I also completed another course on Udacity where I learned the fundamentals of the command line and git.

### **Day 1**

My first day at School of Code. Lots of nervous excitement but met some wonderful people.

#### What we covered

- Introduction to computational thinking, and the importance of breaking problems down into smaller chunks. 
- Chris (our Teacher) talked about Imposter Syndrome; how we need to learn to just deal with it and how it will never really leave us.
- High level overview of agile vs waterfall development and also MVP's (Minimum Viable Products).
- Chris also talked about how the aim of the bootcamp was to mold us into a sort of MVP, so that employers could add to our training and we could develop ourselves further in areas we are interested in.
- Importance of using online resources to our advantage e.g. Google, Stack Overflow etc. 
- Introduction to pair programming. We will do every activity/challenge in pairs. Taking turns to be the driver and navigator. Helping and learning from each other.
- CSS selectors game in pairs. My first experience with pair programming.

### **Day 2** 

- A deeper dive into computational thinking
- Lots of practice using git and github; using clone, add, commit, push , pull, status etc. 
- Chris talked to us about the usefulness of having a baby/child like mentality towards learning how to code: play with the tools, try to break things and then put them back together, see how it works.
- Some more practice with CSS. We made an koala bear cartoon image. 
- Refresher on semantic HTML.

### **Day 3**

The first day of Javascript. Covered so much in one day! Feel glad I covered the basics of JS in my personal course prep, or it could have been very overwhelming. Today we covered:
- Data types and variables 
- If statements
- While loops
- Functions
- We then made a basic password checker algorithm with our pair programming partners.

### **Day 4**

In the morning we had a workshop about the importance of mindset and The Heroes Journey. We also discussed productive ways of giving and recieving feedback.
- Afterwards we immediately dove right back into JavaScript, covering;
- Objects
- Arrays 
- More practice with for and while loops. 

### **Day 5 - Hackathon Friday**

So every Friday is Hackathon friday, where we spend the day completing a project in our pairs. Its a great opportunity to practice and cement the concepts we learned during the week. We then give a 2 minute presentation of our project to other groups at the end of the day. 

Today's challenge was to make a rock scissor paper game. We managed to complete the challenge using functions, arrays, if statements and while loops. The game generated a random move for the computer and also kept track of total games, wins, loses and draws. 

My coding partner and I were quite happy with the outcome of the task, given the limited time and knowledge we have. I'm looking forward to refactoring the code and adding DOM interactivity in my free time.

### **Day 6 and 7 (Sunday and Bank Holiday Monday)**

- Spent some time working through some classes on Scrimba's 'Learn JS for free' course. Reviewing, practicing and cementing some concepts we learned during the week. 
- Introduction to Code Wars. Watched some videos about breaking code wars tasks down and completed a few challenges/ katas. Reached 7 Kyu level.

### **Reflections after week 1 of the School of Code.**

Things I've been reflecting on at the end of the week:

- Taking a few baby steps everyday will soon add up. Consistency is the key.
- Once I got used to pair-programming I can really see the benefits if it. We were catching each other's errors as we went and often we solved problems by just talking it through with each other. 
- The importance of celebrating the little wins and learning from failures. It was especially nice to be be able to share the wins with my coding partner and also to support each other when failing. 
- 'Compare yourself to your past self and not to others'. This is also something our teachers have reiterated several times.
- But also, in relation to the previous point, the reality that Imposter Syndrome is something that will come and go, and how it's basically something I will just have to learn to live with.
- The importance of taking breaks. Applying the mental approach I use in physical excercice such as, 'push forward' and 'dig deeper', seems to actually be a hindrance when trying to solve coding problems. I realised that taking a short break or coming back to the problem later can actually be far more effective.   


### **Day 8**

Every week we are paired with a new partner, so we spend a little bit of time breaking the ice and getting to know each others working/communication styles before cracking on with the day. 

A very intense day, covered a LOT. Didn't have time to finish everything.
- Had a nice talk with some ex-bootcampers this morning. They weree sharing their experience, tips and advice with us. 
- Introduction to the DOM. 
- Practised selecting and manipulating elements.
- Lots of practice with event Listeners and Event Handlers. 

### **Day 9** 

- Before class I reviewed and finished the tasks from yesterday and now feel more confident with the material.
- Introduction to asynchronous functions, promises and Fetch requests.
- We used Fetch to retrieve data from a Kanye West quote api and then displayed the quotes on a webpage. We then created a button that stored the quotes into a list on the webpage and also excluded any repeated quotes from the list.

### **Day 10**

- More practice and workshops using Asynch functions and Fetch; making GET and POST requests.
- Weekly mindset talk , this time focusing on different personality types, the strengths and weaknesses of them.
- Spent some time refactoring my hackathon challenge from the previous week.

### **Day 11 - Hackathon Friday**

- We pair programmed a simple but effective dad joke site using async functions, fetch requests, and event handlers/listeners.
- We spent 30 minutes breaking the problem down and making a plan. We decided to make a high level overview plan which broke the problem up into multiple parts. Once we finished one part we would then zoom in on the next part and make a more detailed plan before completing it. We felt this way of planning/working was more fluid and veratile. It allowed us to respond to possible changes and also was more time effective. 
- We managed to reach our key goals before lunch and were able to focus on our strecth goals, which was to add CSS styling to the site.
- We then gave a two minute presentation of our project to some of our peers at the end of the day.
- I enjoyed using the tools we had learned in a more free-form environment. I.e. Make a plan and solve this problem. 
- When I have some freetime (hopefully over the weekend) I plan to refactor the code, add and input function that lets the user write and add their own joke to either list and clean up the CSS a little bit.


### **Day 12** 

Completed the SoC recap activites, which included;
- Manipulating arrays, searching filtering for specific info.
- Event handlers/listeners review.
- Using setInterval and clearInterval.
- DOM manipulation.
- Adding input vals to list.


### **Week 2 reflections**

Things I've been reflecting on at the end of the week:

- This week felt like a real trial by fire, especially as we had lost a day of study to make up for due to the Bank Holiday.
- I'm getting used to being out of my comfort zone and somewhat comfortable with feeling confused a lot of the time. These moments of confusion are usually followed by brief, shining moments of clarity, before we move on to the next topic and more confusion begins to surround me. But hey, you can't enjoy the sunshine without experiencing the storms.
- Again with the cliches, but the old analogy of the boy falling of his horse, brushing himself off and climbing right back on came to my mind a lot this week. Every day my brain was like fried chicken by end of it, but I would decrompress, workout, relax then return to the materials before class in the mornings to find my understanding deepening and things becoming clearer. Thus, I am beginning to really trust in the learning process described by my teachers last week.
- I'm starting to see the benefits of the SoC slack channel. There is a really supportive and kind community there and I wish to get more involved in it.
- I'm also getting better at debugging. I've come to realise that the error log is often a source of helpful advice and not a cause for panic.


#### **Notes on weekend  homework tasks** 

Honestly this took longer than I expected. Once I completed the tasks I realized that I approached the tasks with the wrong mindset which hindered me greatly. I was just focused on trying to get them done as quickly as possible so that I could attend to some other commitments. I didn't break the problem down, didnt check the code properly as I was writing it and therefore made some silly errors that cost me a lot of time to find and correct. When I got stuck I used the wrong approach of just plowing forward instead of taking a step back and/or a short break, resulting in me just getting stuck further down the rabbit hole.

Thus, I realised that I needed to approach these problems the same way I would any other SoC challenge given during the weekdays: Break the problem down, make a plan and approach it methodically. Use the console.log and read error messages carefully. Make use of resources such as mdn, w3schools and stackoverflow when neccessary.

### **Day 13**

- We looked at the importance of UI/UX design. The difference between the two and the roles/importance of each.
- We then learned about Agile Development and the 12 principles of Agile software Development.
- Waterfall Development vs Agile Development. Advantages and disadvantages of each.
- Played the Can't Unsee game which was a good intro into the power of good design. 
- Some self reflection activities at the end of the day. 

### **Day 14**

- We took a deep dive into the 5 stages of Design Thinking:
    - Emphathise
    - Define
    - Ideate
    - Prototype
    - Test
- We discussed how this can often be an iterative process and we also practiced working through the stages in our own imaginary projects. 
- We also had time for a CSS workshop where we practised using CSS variables and we were able to implement a dark-mode feature on a simple website. 
- Solved a couple of Code Wars challenges in our pairs

### **Day 15** 

- Deeper dive into UI, and the elements and principles of design.
- Color theory and accessibility.
- We also looked at the LightHouse feature in Devtools.
- Introduction to wire-framing and practised making a mock-up wireframe using miro and figma.
- workshop on organising and maintaining CSS code. We also covered specificity.


### **Day 16**

- Workshop on perspectives and ideas, listening to and communicating ideas effectively.
- We talked about importance of not get getting too attached to our ideas. 
- CSS flexbox, using vh and vw for sizing. Also looked at how to select elements in the most efficient and sustainable ways.
- In the afternoon we worked in groups of 4 to complete a UX challenge. The challenge was to create some wireframes for a competitor to Google Maps. We managed to complete some medium fidelity wireframes and then presented them to our peers. 

### **Day 17**

- Followed the Design Thinking Process and UI/UX planning principles we learned this week to design a personal portfolio website.
- I created user personas and stories, then made a first draft and final version of my low-fidelity  wireframe on Miro.
- I actually really enjoyed the process and was surprised by this. I spent a good chunk of my Saturday night creating the wireframes whilst listening to music and have no regrets. It was fun to put myself in the user’s shoes and try to design something that would meet their needs and expectations.
- I also cleaned up my Linkedin profile and began to upload my daily progress on LinkedIn instead of Twitter.

### **Day 18**

-This morning I created the high fidelity wire-frame for my portfolio website on Figma. I’m pretty happy with it, all in all. There are a few things that need tweaking, but I’ll let it sit in my mind for a while and have another look at it in a couple of days. 
- I’ll begin planning and building it in HTML and CSS in the morning. 



### **Reflections after the Week 3 of School of Code**

UI/UX week was an interesting change of direction. After some initial trepidation I ended up really enjoying it. 

This was my first experience making wireframes digitally rather than just sketching things on paper. Miro was easy to pick up but I found Figma hard to grasp and was initially put off by it. I watched a couple of tutorials and had a play around and began to feel much more comfortable with it. There is still a LOT for me to learn about Figma but I’m inspired by the possibilities it offers. Increased complexity comes with a steeper learning curve so I just need to spend more time with it.

I really enjoyed the Hackathon challenge on Friday and was happy with what we created in a short period of time. My partner and I got along well and were able to communicate effectively which helped move the project along immensely. This changed my perspective on the whole 5 stage design process as I had a less satisfactory experience the day prior working in a team that didn’t gel/communicate as well.

This also made we reflect on the workshop we had on Thursday morning about the importance of listening and not getting attached to our ideas. After Fridays Hackathon I also really saw the benefits of cognitive diversity in teams, as my coding partner and I really had fun bouncing ideas off one another and coming up with things that we would not of thought of by ourselves. 

I spent the weekend planning and designing my prospective portfolio page leading to a high fidelity wireframe that I am pretty happy with, although a few tweaks still need to be made.  I enjoyed the process much more than I expected and really lost myself in it for most of the weekend. 

I’ll see how the rest of the bootcamp goes but I might look more into UI/UX design as a potential career path. 

As a side note, I also discovered Trello, which was a real game changer in terms of organizing my to-do-lists and resource lists 

### Day 19 ###

- Introduction to Node and npm.
- A quick overview of the Event Loop.
- Pair programming workshop activity where we practised importing and exporting modules and importing npm packages.
- We were also introduced to and practised using the .gitignore file.
- I had to wrestle with Node version manager for a good portion of the afternoon workshop and so completed the tasks in the evening.
- Also, in the morning we completed some HTML, CSS and JS review quizzes. I was pleasantly surprised by my scores :)

### Day 20 ###

- Review of the topics from yesterday.
- Importing and exporting using ES6 syntax and default JS syntax. 
- Intro to Express and created some simple servers and a very simple API.
- There was a lot of info to take in today. This is my first experience with the back-end, -and things aren’t fully clicking yet, but I’m ok with that. I’m becoming more comfortable with being uncomfortable. 
- Also attended an after class workshop hosted by some of the great coaches, which helped clarify a few things for me. 

### Day 21 ###

- Routing API’s and separation of concerns into different modules.
- Practiced handling and routing queries. 
- Not sure if all the above terminology is correct as I’m still learning and getting my head around the concepts. 
- I’m feeling a bit more comfortable with the logic and syntax of Express after some more practice today.  Breaking things down really helped.
-  Also talking things through with my coding partner helped me to gain more understanding of some concepts, especially in regards to handling queries from the client side.
- In the afternoon we were also introduced to REST API and CRUD operations.



### Day 22 ###

- Great mindset workshop in the morning about our Inner Critic and building resilience.
- We each gave a two minute presentation about something we had learned recently and had ten minutes to prepare for it. I presented a quick presentation demonstrating the layout grid system in Figma.
- In the afternoon we were split into groups of four, given a random topic and had just over an hour to prepare a four minute presentation on it. We were asked to give a presentation on CORS which I had no prior knowledge of. To be frank I don’t think I presented very well as I was still struggling to grasp the concepts of CORS by the time we presented, but it’s all part of the learning journey.
- We were also introduced to middleware in Express, and performed basic POST requests using postman. We will have more time to play around with this and cement our knowledge further during Friday’s Hackathon challenge :)


### Day 23 ###

Our challenge this week was to build the backend of a recipe website.
- We set up a router and server that listened for requests from the client. The requests included:
- GET request that listed all the recipes available.
- GET request that displayed a particular recipe requested by the user(requested by inputting the id number of the recipe.)
- POST request that created a new recipe.
- PUT request that updated a recipe.
- DELETE request that deleted a recipe.
- We also had time to complete one of the bonus tasks which was to create models that allowed us to export/import some of the logic from the requests and store them elsewhere; leading to more reusable and cleaner code. 

I would like to thank the fantastic coaches at School of Code for offering a guiding hand when we got stuck on a task. :) 

### Day 24 ###
 
- I completed the School of Code weekend recap tasks, which reviewed and cemented the things we learned during the week. Ie. Making GET,POST,PUT and DELETE requests. Importing and exporting modules etc.
- I also reviewed our code from the Hackathon challenge to review the concepts and ensure I understood how everything works.
- Watched ‘Keep betting on JavaScript video’ in preparation for a guest talk from Kyle Simpson on Monday
- I updated my #100DaysofCode diary on my Github Readme repository. 


### Reflections after week 4 of School of Code ###

This week we were introduced to Node and Express. This was my first experience with the back-end and there was a lot of information and new concepts to absorb.
There were times when I felt overwhelmed, and some negative talk crept into my mind, but I reminded myself that Rome wasn’t built in a day. I also remembered how I felt the same way during the middle of weeks 2 and 3, but ended those weeks feeling much more comfortable with the concepts after I stuck with it. 

My coding partner took to the back-end like a fish to water. At first, this unnerved me a bit, to be honest. But I also realized that it was a great opportunity for me to learn from her. She was very patient and talked through the concepts with me. 

This week I also learned to fully appreciate the benefits of adding comments to my code. Taking that time to comment properly really helps to gain a deeper understanding when writing and reviewing code. it also saves a lot of confusion when revisiting old code a few days after writing it. 

This week I was also blown away by the kindness I found in the Tech Community. I worked on improving my LinkedIn profile, as last week I only had two connections (one of which was my girlfriend. haha). I reached out to past School of Code graduates and current students and was amazed by the number of well wishes and support I got from people I had never met before. A few people even messaged me saying that I was welcome to approach them with questions or for advice.  The kindness shown to me melted my heart, and I hope to pass on this kindness to others as I walk further down this path into the world of Tech.

### Day 25 ###

- Today we were introduced to databases. We looked at the difference between relational and non-relational databases.
- We looked at using CRUD operations in PostgresSQL and had some time to play around with Creating, updating, reading and deleting data using db-fiddle.com
- We had an interesting talk from Kyle Simpson who talked to us about Imposter Syndrome and the importance of accessibility.
- In the morning I managed to complete a couple of the bonus tasks from our weekend tasks and Friday Hackathon challenge. 

### Day 26 ###

- We took a deep dive into SQL. We created tables and then were introduced to and practised using the WHERE clause as well as some new queries including; AND, OR, BETWEEN, NOT BETWEEN, IN, NOT IN, LIKE, NOT LIKE, %, and DISTINCT.
- We also looked at the ORDER BY keyword and ASC/DESC.
- In the afternoon we experimented with joining tables and looked at the various types of JOIN.
- We then worked through some exercises on SQLbolt and pgexcercises.com
